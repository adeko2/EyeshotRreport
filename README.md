# Eyeshot Report

## 1. Issue - Loading an entity takes an enormous amount of time and allocates GBs of memory.

[project](https://github.com/adeko2/EyeshotRreport/tree/master/EyeshotReport)
We (Adeko Technologies) have observed an abnormal behaviour during loading an entity produced from a dwg source.

- The app seems to be stuck in an infinite loop insideÂ `design1.Entities.Add(blockReference)`
- The app continues to allocate memory with a high speed without slowing down. During our test case we reached out to 14 GB of memory.
- this is only observed when the process is invoked by the ContentRendered event of the MainWindow.
